    <h2>What is Automeme?</h2>
    <p>
        Automeme is the groundbreaking meme generation, also refered
        to as 'memeration,' web tool designed from the ground up to best fit
        the needs of our user base. Using revolutionary technologies such as
        Portable Network Graphics and the File Transfer Protocol, we at Automeme
        can give you the best memeration service we can offer.

    <h2>Why is Automeme?</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike all the other memeration technologies out there, we at Automeme
        pride ourselves on our simplicity. We here at Automeme ask the questions
        that no other in memeration technology asks, like "Why would you need more
        than two text boxes?" or "Who needs more than a 500x500 resolution?" Through
        Automeme we have answered these questions with a resounding "You don't!"
